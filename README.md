# discord-CodeCopier
A Javascript that sends some discord rich-presence that shows you're copying code from StackOverflow as a joke.

Due that people are asking me on discord how i did it, this is how i did it.

To install it,


make sure to have nodejs and npm installed.

also make sure to install https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rich-presence and all of it's dependencies.

`node index.js` to run this. make sure to run this on the same machine where your discord is running.

Sourcecode for a simple C# console starter is included, make sure to compile it into the same folder as the main JavaScript files. only works on Windows, sorry.
