# discord-moneyprinter
A shitty JaVaScRiPT that sends some discord rich-presence that shows that you're printing money on discord as a joke.

Due that people are asking me on discord how i did it, this is how i did it.

To install it,


make sure to have nodejs installed.

`npm install` to create the massive blackhole on your harddrive.
make sure to install https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-rich-presence and all of it's dependencies.
`node index.js` to run this. make sure to run this on the same machine where your discord is running.
